My expectations for this course is that I will learn new things and I will be able to apply the exisiting knowledge I have.
I also expect to encounter difficulties and problems while doing activities, but surely I will overcome it. Lastly, I expect 
to enjoy, have fun, and chill in this course. :)

I agree to Kiefer's statement about encountering problems doing activities but I'm pretty sure we can overcome these! :D
